    <h2>Rebuilding the react components, Again and Again?</h2>
    <p>Let’s be real—how many times have you copied a Button.jsx from your last project, adjusted a few styles, and moved on?</p>
    <p>We’ve all been there. And honestly, it's fine—until you’re juggling five projects and every button behaves differently.</p>
    <p>That's why we created UIBrix: a clean, modular, and open-source library of reusable React + Next.js components made to save your time, keep your UI consistent, and help the dev community grow together.</p>
